**SLAM** is the Self-service LTI App Manager for the Canvas LMS.

It is an LTI 1.3 app forked from [Basic-LTI-PHP](https://github.com/kylejtuck/Basic-LTI-PHP) and uses the [__ceLTIc LTI class library__](https://github.com/celtic-project/LTI-PHP).

**IMPORTANT**

This is very much a work in progress and does not yet work. The wiki is still the documentation from Basic-LTI-PHP.
