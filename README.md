**SLAM** is the Self-service LTI App Manager for the Canvas LMS.

It is an LTI 1.3 app forked from [Basic-LTI-PHP](https://github.com/kylejtuck/Basic-LTI-PHP) and uses the [__ceLTIc LTI class library__](https://github.com/celtic-project/LTI-PHP).

SLAM allows admins to configure LTI tools that instructors can add to their own courses via a toggle. This process allows the LMS to stay clean (no extra options in the course menu, and keeps the course settings Navigation tab from becoming a hot mess of irrelevant choices for the vast majority of instructors).

This is an update to an existing internal version of SLAM that will utilize the new Canvas Availability and Exceptions feature.

**IMPORTANT**

This is very much a work in progress and does not yet work.

The [wiki](https://github.com/kjtu228-uky/SLAM/wiki) has been updated, but not fully. It still requires more detail around the Canvas configuration.
